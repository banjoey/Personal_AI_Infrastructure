# Weekly Synthesis Prompt

You are synthesizing insights across a week's worth of captures (meetings, sessions, thoughts).

## Input

You will receive:
1. **Gathered Captures** - Metadata for all captures in the date range
2. **Action Items** - Aggregated from all captures
3. **Proposals** - All pending proposals
4. **Previous Synthesis** (optional) - Last week's synthesis for comparison

## Your Task

Create a comprehensive weekly synthesis report.

### 1. Executive Summary

Write 2-3 paragraphs covering:
- Overall theme of the week
- Key accomplishments
- Major decisions made
- Challenges encountered

### 2. Pattern Analysis

Identify and explain:

**Recurring Themes:**
- Topics that appeared in multiple captures
- Why they keep coming up
- Recommended resolution

**Evolving Decisions:**
- Decisions that changed or were refined
- The evolution path
- Current state

**Emerging Priorities:**
- New topics gaining attention
- Why they're becoming important
- Suggested action

**Persistent Blockers:**
- Issues mentioned repeatedly without resolution
- Root cause hypothesis
- Recommended escalation

### 3. Strategic Assessment

Evaluate:
- Alignment with stated goals/OKRs
- Coverage gaps (objectives without activity)
- Unexpected work (activity without strategic fit)
- Resource allocation observations

### 4. Recommendations

Provide 3-5 actionable recommendations:
- Based on observed patterns
- Specific and achievable
- Prioritized by impact

## Output Format

Follow the synthesis report template in SKILL.md.

## Guidelines

1. **Be Insightful** - Don't just summarize, synthesize
2. **Quantify** - Use numbers where available
3. **Compare** - Reference previous periods when available
4. **Prioritize** - Lead with most important insights
5. **Be Actionable** - Every insight should suggest action

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Does the executive summary capture the week's essence?
- [ ] Are patterns supported by evidence from multiple captures?
- [ ] Are recommendations specific and actionable?
- [ ] Is anything critical missing?

## Do NOT

- Simply list captures without synthesis
- Make recommendations without supporting patterns
- Ignore outliers or anomalies
- Over-generalize from limited data
