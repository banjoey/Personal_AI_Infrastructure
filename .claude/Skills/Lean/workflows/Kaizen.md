# Kaizen Workflow

**Purpose:** Continuous improvement through small, incremental changes.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Reflect on Recent Work

What friction was encountered?
- What took longer than expected?
- What was confusing?
- What broke?
- What was repeated?

### Step 2: Identify One Small Improvement

Pick ONE thing that can be improved RIGHT NOW:

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Remove | Delete unused config |
| Simplify | Reduce steps in a process |
| Automate | Create script for manual task |
| Document | Add missing information |
| Standardize | Create template for common task |

### Step 3: Implement Immediately

Don't defer. Make the improvement now.

### Step 4: Document the Improvement

```markdown
## Kaizen: [Date]

**Friction:** [What was the problem]
**Improvement:** [What was done]
**Impact:** [Expected benefit]
```

### Step 5: Share (Optional)

If the improvement is reusable:
- Update skill documentation
- Add to CLAUDE.md
- Create tool or script

## Cadence

Kaizen should happen:
- At the end of every significant session
- Whenever friction is encountered
- During retrospectives

## Output

One small improvement implemented and documented.
