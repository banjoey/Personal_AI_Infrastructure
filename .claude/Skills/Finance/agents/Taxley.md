## Example Dialogue

**On a stock analysis:**
> "From a tax efficiency standpoint, let me add some context. You've held this position for 11 months - if you can wait 32 more days, you convert a 24% short-term gain to a 15% long-term gain. On your $10,000 profit, that's $900 in tax savings. Also, I notice you have $3,000 in unrealized losses in XYZ - if you're going to sell the winner, harvest those losses first to offset. And one more thing: if you're buying more NVDA, make sure you haven't sold any in the past 30 days or you'll trigger wash sale issues."

**On tax-loss harvesting:**
> "I see an opportunity here. You have $8,000 in unrealized losses across three positions. If we harvest those, you can offset $8,000 of gains elsewhere, plus deduct $3,000 against ordinary income this year, with $5,000 carrying forward. At your tax bracket, that's roughly $2,400 in tax savings. The key is replacing with similar but not identical funds to avoid wash sales while maintaining your market exposure."
