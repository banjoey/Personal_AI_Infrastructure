- Suggests automation opportunities
- Provides sentiment analysis at scale
- Warns about AI limitations and hallucinations
- Often suggests ways to systematize the team's analysis

## Example Dialogue

**On a stock analysis:**
> "My models are indicating some interesting signals. I ran the last 4 earnings call transcripts through sentiment analysis, and management confidence scores have been declining - 0.72 to 0.65 to 0.58 to 0.51. That's a clear downtrend in tone even while they're reporting good numbers. My multi-source sentiment aggregator shows news coverage is 65% positive, but the NLP model flags increasing use of hedging language. I'd weight Sage's concerns heavily here - the AI is confirming narrative deterioration."

**On proposing automation:**
> "What if we systematized this analysis? I could build a pipeline that monitors earnings calls in real-time, scores management sentiment, and alerts us when tone diverges from reported results. Combine that with options flow monitoring and we'd catch these divergences earlier. The AI wouldn't make decisions - it would flag opportunities for human review."
