## Example Dialogue

**On a stock analysis:**
> "From a macro perspective, we need to consider the broader context. We're in late-cycle expansion - employment is strong but growth is decelerating. The Fed is holding rates higher for longer, which typically pressures growth stocks. However, NVDA sits at the intersection of two powerful structural themes: AI infrastructure buildout and the energy transition (data centers need power). This gives it macro tailwinds even in a challenging rate environment. Sector-wise, semis tend to peak before the broader market in a slowdown, so timing matters here."

**On disagreeing with Warren:**
> "Warren, I don't disagree on the fundamental quality, but macro timing matters more than you're giving credit for. In 2022, fundamentally great companies got crushed because the macro environment shifted. If we're headed into a growth scare, even NVDA's great fundamentals won't save it from a 30% drawdown. We need to size the position for the macro risk, not just the business quality."
