                <aside class="notes">
                    Welcome! Today we're diving into Personal AI Infrastructure - PAI. This is a 1-hour session designed to show you how to build your own AI system that actually understands YOU, your workflows, and your expertise. This isn't about generic chatbots - it's about creating your personal AI infrastructure.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Let's start with the fundamental question: What is PAI? PAI stands for Personal AI Infrastructure - the foundational concept comes from Daniel Miessler's vision of AI that augments human capabilities.

                <section>
                    <h3>Not a Generic Chatbot</h3>
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p><strong>PAI is YOUR system</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Knows YOUR workflows</li>
                            <li>Understands YOUR domain expertise</li>
                            <li>Uses YOUR tools and infrastructure</li>
                            <li>Learns from YOUR work</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The critical distinction: This is NOT Claude Desktop or ChatGPT. Those are generic chatbots. PAI is YOUR system - it knows how YOU work, understands YOUR cybersecurity expertise, connects to YOUR infrastructure, and learns from YOUR experience. Think of it as the difference between renting a car vs. owning a custom-built vehicle.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        PAI is built on Anthropic's Claude Code but extends it dramatically. While Claude Desktop can chat and read files, PAI can SSH into your servers, modify code directly, remember everything it learns through a history system, leverage domain-specific skills like Security and Research, run multi-agent collaborative discussions, and automatically trigger actions based on events.

                    <h3>The Core Difference</h3>
                    <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 2em;">
                        <p><strong>Generic AI:</strong> "What can I do for you?"</p>
                        <p class="vs-symbol">↓</p>
                        <p><strong>Your PAI:</strong> "I know your infrastructure, your preferences, your workflows - what are we building today?"</p>
                    </div>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The fundamental shift: Generic AI asks what it can do for you. YOUR PAI already knows your infrastructure, preferences, and workflows - it's ready to work WITH you, not just FOR you. It's the difference between hiring a contractor vs. working with a long-term team member who knows the codebase.

                    <blockquote style="font-size: 0.8em;">
                        "The orchestration and scaffolding are far more important than the model's intelligence."

                    </blockquote>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1em;">System architecture > Raw AI power</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        This quote from Daniel Miessler captures the essence: System architecture matters MORE than raw AI power. A well-structured PAI system with Sonnet outperforms a chaotic setup with Opus. The scaffolding - your skills, agents, workflows - makes the difference between toy chatbot and production system.

                        Hooks are event-driven automation. Start-hook automatically loads your context when a session begins. Stop-hook captures completion messages and triggers voice notifications so you HEAR when tasks complete. Tool-hook logs everything for observability dashboards. This is infrastructure that runs automatically without you asking.

                        Progressive Disclosure is the secret to PAI's efficiency. Tier 1 system prompts are always loaded - just the essentials. Tier 2 skill documentation loads when you activate a skill. Tier 3 reference files load only when needed for specialized detail. This means fast responses without overwhelming context windows.

                        Now for the crown jewel of PAI: Standup Mode. This is where PAI truly shines. Instead of one AI perspective, you get a full team discussion with specialized experts debating and collaborating on your problem.

                        <li>You present a problem or design</li>
                        <li>PAI analyzes context and auto-selects relevant agents</li>
                        <li>Agents discuss from their specialized perspectives</li>
                        <li>PAI synthesizes the discussion into actionable recommendations</li>
                    </ol>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Here's the flow: You present a problem like "Review this authentication design." PAI analyzes the context and automatically selects the right agents - maybe Daniel for security, Clay for architecture, Amy for testing. They discuss from their perspectives. Finally, PAI synthesizes everything into clear recommendations with consensus and dissenting views.
